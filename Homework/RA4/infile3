one time my drama class's teacher had gone home sick so we were just put in a classroom with a 
movie to entertain us for the period when an alarm went off. none of us were sure if it was
 the fire alarm or the lockdown alarm, so we all head out into the hall to check and no one's 
out there, so we head back in, and climb under our desks, as is lockdown procedure. cut to an 
hour or so later when a teacher bursts in and nearly dies of relief because the school was on 
fire and we were the only students not accounted for and half the faculty and fire department 
had been searching for us for ages. literally, the whole school had filled with smoke while 
we'd kept super safe under our wooden desks.
